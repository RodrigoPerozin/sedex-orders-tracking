### What is this program , and how it works..

Whew, this program was created because i was tired of doing the <a href="rastreamento.correios.com.br">correios</a> captchas for each consult, so i wrote this script for
anyone that want to skip the captcha.

The program is simple, you just type the order code, and then go do anything while the app run, you will be notified when your order status change.

In case of <a href="rastreamento.correios.com.br">correios</a> read this. Yes, i am a robot.

<p>First, we need to install the program dependencies:</p>
